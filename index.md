What is this website?
----

This wiki was created with the goal of documenting information and knowledge on a broad variety of subjects in the most concise way possible.

Use the navigation menu at the top of the page to access different parts of the wiki. Areas are divided based on application or information type, then there are different types of pages within each selection.

<h4>Guides</h4>
These pages aim to teach a specific technique or how to fix a certain problem. They'll be split up into steps to keep guides concise and easy to follow. Each guide shouldn't take more than about 5 mins to read through and should be fairly self contained, only teaching what is needed for that guide.
<h4>Lists</h4>
These pages will act as an index for noteworthy content, usually linking to pages off site. An example would be a page that lists all of the most useful Blender addons.

How can I help?

If you wish to make any changes to the wiki yourself, feel free to check out the [<b style="color:deepskyblue;">Github</b>](https://github.com/viri-space/knowmore) page and make a pull request.

This site is being hosted directly through Github pages, so any changes made to the master branch will be immediately shown on the site. Using Github for a project like this makes collaborating a lot easier.

Any help at all is appreciated, though I still have final say on what makes it on to the wiki. I will comment on any pull requests that I think need changes before they can be merged into the master branch.

While this wiki hosts information on a wide range of topics I would like to keep the general formatting the same across all articles. I'll be providing a general formatting guide for this wiki as soon as possible. Pages will only be approved if they follow this guide.

If you find an issue with the site you can create an issue on the Github repo [<b style="color:white;background:black;padding:1px 5px;border:solid 1px">here</b>](https://github.com/viri-space/knowmore/issues)

This is a collection of links that I find worth reading. I've divided them into sections based on topic. Might integrate these links into other pages once I have stuff properly setup.

Unity
---------

  * [Lin's Unity Packages](https://github.com/oofdesu/lin-unity-packages)

Blender
---------

  * [Cats Blender Plugin](https://catsblenderplugin.com/homepage)

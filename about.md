  <h1>What is this website?</h1>
</div>
<div class="obj bg">
  <p>This site was created with the goal of documenting information and knowledge on a broad variety of subjects in the most concise way possible.</p>
  <p>Use the navigation menu at the top of the page to access different parts of the wiki. Areas are divided based on application or information type, then there are different types of pages within each section. These different types are listed below.</p>

    <p>Guides</p>
    <p>These pages aim to teach a specific technique or how to fix a certain problem. They'll be split up into steps to keep guides concise and easy to follow. Each guide shouldn't take more than about 5 mins to read through and should be fairly self contained, only teaching what is needed for that guide.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="obj bg fl-30">
    <p>Lists</p>
    <p>These pages will act as an index for noteworthy content, usually linking to pages off site. An example would be a page that lists all of the most useful Blender addons. Lists can consist of anything, such as a list of addons, websites, or programs.</p>

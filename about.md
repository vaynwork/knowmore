## What is this website?

This wiki was created with the goal of documenting information and knowledge on a broad variety of subjects in the most concise way possible.

Use the navigation menu at the top of the page to access different parts of the wiki. Areas are divided based on application or information type, then there are different types of pages within each section. These different types are listed below.

#### Introduction
Each section of this wiki starts with an Introduction page. This exists to introduce what the section is about, whether it is a specific application or a platform or a programming language. This page tries to a give a brief intro covering the most important topics so that a complete novice can delve further into the topic.

#### Guides
These pages aim to teach a specific technique or how to fix a certain problem. They'll be split up into steps to keep guides concise and easy to follow. Each guide shouldn't take more than about 5 mins to read through and should be fairly self contained, only teaching what is needed for that guide.

#### Lists
These pages will act as an index for noteworthy content, usually linking to pages off site. An example would be a page that lists all of the most useful Blender addons. These are **not** Top 10/15/20 lists. Lists can consist of anything, such as a list of addons, websites,

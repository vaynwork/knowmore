      <p>This site is being hosted directly through Github pages, so any changes made to the master branch will be immediately shown on the site. Using Github for a project like this makes collaborating a lot easier.
      Any help at all is appreciated, though I still have final say on what makes it on to the wiki. I will comment on any pull requests that I think need changes before they can be merged into the master branch.

      While this wiki hosts information on a wide range of topics I would like to keep the general formatting the same across all articles. I'll be providing a general formatting guide for this wiki as soon as possible. Pages will only be approved if they follow this guide.</p>
